# Classic Snake Game

## Requirements

This game requires Python 3.x installed on your PC as well as the Pygame library. After installed, go to the game's directory via the command line and run 'python3 snake.py'

## Overview

This is a simple recreation of the Snake game. The main purpose of this game was to learn a little about Pygame and try my hand at creating Snake.

## Controls and Gameplay

Use WASD to control the snake's direction. Your score goes up each time the snake eats a green square, as does the length of the snake.
